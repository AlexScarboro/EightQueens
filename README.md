# EightQueens
The eight queens problem is a common puzzle in which eight queens are to be placed on a chess board. No two queens can be in the same column, row, or diagonal.

To solve this problem using the Hill-Climbing algorithm with random restarts, we must first generate a random starting state which places a queen in a random row of each column. From there, we first check to see if the state is a goal state (no queens are in conflict). If not, we evaluate all of the possible neighbor states by moving each columnâ€™s queen through the rows of its column and generating a heuristic value for each of those states. When all of the neighbor states have been generated, we check to see if any states were generated that have a lower heuristic value than the current state. If a better state was not found, then we have reached the local minima and must perform a random restart. If a better (lower heuristic) state was found, then that state becomes the current state and the above process is repeated on that state.
